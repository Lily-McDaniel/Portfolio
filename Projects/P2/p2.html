          <p> I wanted to sign up for this Software Engineering Micro-Credential because I am looking to expand my technical skills. I have been interested in learning about software engingering ever since COVID 19 began, but I have had a difficult time figuring out how/where to get started. Once I heard about the Micro-Credential, I knew that this would be the perfect opportunity to kick start my software engineering journey. Ultimately, I would love to obtain an internship in this field to enforce and solidfy everything that I have learned over the next 5-weeks and possbily transition into a more tech focused career path. </p>
